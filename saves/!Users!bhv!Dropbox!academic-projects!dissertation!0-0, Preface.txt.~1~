# Preface

The right to private property is one of the core axioms of American
economic life, and like most axioms, it's difficult to think about. It
seems obvious and necessary to say that everyone has the right to do
what they want with the things that are theirs, at least within
reason. The law sets the ground rules for fair exchanges of one
person's property with another's, so that nobody gets cheated. Ethics
elaborates on what "within reason" means in particular cases,
encouraging people to use their resources in a socially responsible
way. Yet even to start thinking about those questions, we have to
assume first that everyone does have a right to private property.

As this dissertation will demonstrate, this way of thinking about
private property can legitimately be called Christian. It began to
emerge in a series of medieval debates about creation and nature,
about history and eternity, about human intellect and will, and
especially about how to live a life worthy of the one Francis of
Assisi called "the naked Christ"--who was born poor, refused to accept
wealth or power, and was stripped even of the clothes he wore before
being put to death. But as Francis's example already suggests, the
Christian tradition has had other ways of thinking about private
property, too. The central irony of the story I want to tell, in fact,
is that the modern concern for the protection of private property
rights has its deepest roots in a Christian movement that claimed,
like Christ, not to own anything at all. Christianity has had a
complex relationship with private property, to say the least, and
recovering some of that complexity is one way to provide some of the
critical distance about our economic assumptions which is otherwise so
hard to come by.

A number of Christian thinkers over the last century have tried to
reframe private property as a theological issue. Catholic social
teaching, beginning with Leo XIII's _Rerum novarum_ in 1891, has
returned repeatedly to private property. That tradition emphasized
