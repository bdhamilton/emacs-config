# Notes from David on dissertation proposal

1. Identify audience (primary and secondary--state them and their
   relationship)
    * For theologians? Right now, audience is intellectual
      historians. Particularly those interested in religious impact on
      social movements.
	* What are theologians' questions? Christian ethicists questions?
      Say up front how this dissertation speaks to them. E.g., natural
      law, distinctiveness of Christian ethics, church/state... **List
      5 theological themes to keep in mind.**
2. What are the theological themes or categories that can relate the
   two audiences?
    * How a particular social-religious practice affects theoretical
      debates in a broader sphere.
	* Connect the poverty debates, e.g., to debates over the nature of
      the human subject, the virtuous life, voluntarism.
	* _Treat this dissertation as a model of how to relate Christian
      ethics and theology to history._

Intro: identify target audience, identify method

Conclusions: suggest a number of ways that hte material will be useful
to people.

Property as a theological issue: why? It's related to creation, to
