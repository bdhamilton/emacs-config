# Timeline

From September 2012 through February 28 there are 18 months. Say I have six chapters, an introduction, and a conclusion. That's eight chapters. Let's say I can take three months to get each of the first two chapters done, and two months each after that.

By the end of the summer 2012, I should have key texts and broader bibliographies identified for each chapter of the dissertation, so I don't spend a week at the start of working on each chapter just figuring out what I need to be working on. It will morph of course, but a list of key texts and a bibliography will give me a place to start.
