% Franciscan Poverty and the Right to Private Property
% Brian Hamilton-Vise

The right to private property holds a place of high honor in the
American economic imagination, but our recent debt crisis has made it
clearer than ever that too simple an affirmation of that right can cut
against justice. So the tide is turning: political thinkers are
becoming more and more critical of the right to private property and
its role in justifying contemporary inequality. Yet because those
thinkers rarely approach the problem with much historical perspective,
their critiques often end up as simple as what they oppose.

My goal is to contribute to a re-appraisal of the right to private
property by telling the story of its origins. The idea first came to
expression in high medieval Europe, amid a series of debates over the
value of voluntary poverty in an early capitalist society. I will
focus especially on Franciscan thinkers such as Bonaventure, Pope
Nicholas IV, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham; and on their
detractors such as William of Saint-Amour, Gerard of Abbeville, and
Pope John XXII. It is in John XXII's 1323 condemnation of the
traditional Franciscan doctrine of poverty that the idea of a natural
right to private property first appears in a recognizably modern
form. Its invention, in other words, depended on a movement meant
partly to resist the new economic order. By telling that story, I will
be able to illumine the deep political ambiguity that still underlies
the idea of a natural right to private property.


# Thesis

My main thesis is this: in a surprisingly short period of time,
between the beginnings of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
private property went from being seen as a _pragmatic human response
to the fall_ to being seen as _a natural subjective right_. Before,
private property was a legal invention that did not and would not
exist in paradise, though it was perhaps necessary in our fallen
condition. After, private property was simply a structural part of
human life. It was not constructed but divinely ordained, and could
not be replaced any more than breathing or language.

The old picture prevailed all through the early church and into the
early Middle Ages. Yet it depended for its intelligibility partly on
the socioeconomic conditions of the late antique Roman empire, and was
therefore undermined by the rise and fall of feudalism and by the
birth pangs of a capitalist order. Reacting to these socioeconomic
changes, a series of religious movements arose in the 12th and 13th
centuries that identified themselves with the poor and resisted the
growing importance of money and private property. Although in many
ways these movements carried on the older theological view of
property, they were usually treated--sometimes correctly--as a serious
threat to the political and ecclesiastical status quo. When they
attained an official form in the Franciscan order, their original
commitments were almost immediately compromised. Still, the
Franciscans introduced a new set of tensions into mainstream political
and economic debates that eventually issued in a novel theory of
property and poverty as juridical relations between human beings and
the things they used. Combined with an emerging legal focus on
individual human beings, that theory had some practical effects
continuous with the original aims of the poverty movements, and other
effects that cut against those aims. When in 1323 Pope John XXII
defined _any_ rightful relation between individuals and their things
as private property--declaring heretical (and indeed unthinkable) the
Franciscan commitment to a life without property--the transformation
was complete, and the ambivalence of the Franciscan legacy was
secured. John XXII's condemnation marks the symbolic death of the
older understanding of private property as a constructed political
institution with determinate political aims, and the birth of an
understanding of private property as a natural cornerstone of human
society, with all the advantages and disadvantages that entails.

# State of the Question

There are three ways in which the history of property rights usually
gets told. The dominant story--embedded in the liberal political
tradition and in mainline economics--is that the right to private
property has no history beyond its recognition or refusal: it has
always and everywhere been the basis of economic life, and even of
political society. By simply recalling some of this supposedly
non-existent history, this dissertation will destabilize that story
and put us in position to ask more critical questions about the form
of that right. Marxists, secondly, have usually told a very different
story in which private property properly so called emerges only with
the slow collapse of feudalism, the dispersal of fixed land labor
(especially to the cities), and the depersonalization of wage
contracts. That story is, from my perspective, more nearly right. Yet
its proponents tend to treat those factors as decisive by themselves:
bourgeois capitalist relations emerge in the late Middle Ages because
they were necessary for the development of productive forces in what
had become a feudal stasis, but now those same relations _hinder_
productive development and need to be swept away. No one considers the
cultural or intellectual context in which those relations emerged and
were justified. Once we do, private property appears much more
ambiguous _both_ in the late medieval and in the contemporary
contexts.

Beyond these standard stories, another tends to dominate within the
theological guild. There, scholars recognize the broad outlines of the
shift I'm trying to explain: they see that in the early church and in
the Middle Ages property was understood differently than it is now,
and that some crucial change occurred around the turn of the 14th
century. That change is usually seen as constituted by a loss of a
sense of collective obligation, and usually attributed to the rise of
a cosmology in which individual human will held pride of
place. Private property itself is not very often a topic of
conversation among theologians--and in fact, only John Milbank
directly ties this medieval shift to the birth of a _natural right_ to
private property--but some form of this story is told whenever the
topic does arise.^[It will become clearer and clearer as I unfold the
story of the emergence of the right to private property that
theologians _ought_ to be giving more attention to private property
than they have. For one thing, the history of the idea is deeply
entangled with theological concepts they can explain with more finesse
than can most legal or economic historians; for another, that history
helps to clarify the political significance of certain theological
themes often treated in abstraction.]

To both Marxists and theologians, for different reasons, the 13th and
14th centuries thus appear as a key turning point in the history of
private property. Yet in both cases the picture remains extremely
fuzzy and incomplete. Neither has given much sustained historical
attention to the period, usually covering it quickly and in
preparation for discussions of later developments. And in the
attention they have given it, Marxists have tended to downplay
'superstructural' factors while theologians have tended to downplay
'infrastructural' ones.

In trying to explain the emergence of the right to private property,
therefore, I'll mainly be in conversation with medieval
historians. Quite a few historians have attended concretely to the
changing significance of property in the Middle Ages, though even
here the attention has usually been oblique.

Unsurprisingly, the most direct attention has come from scholars of
medieval legal and political theory. Legal and political theory saw a
massive revival in the high Middle Ages, as political networks that
had lain fallow for centuries were being turned and revived. Central
to that revival was a return to Roman law, and central to Roman law
was the notion of _dominium_, which meant both 'sovereignty' and
'private property.' Scholars like Brian Tierney, Paolo Grossi, and
Janet Coleman have done significant work tracking the different
interpretations of _dominium_ between the 12th and 14th
centuries.

What these scholars will contribute to my dissertation--besides, of
course, close readings of key medieval theorists--is an awareness of
how private property both as an idea and as an institution fits into
the broader political developments of the period. That includes, for
example, the deliberate attempts to re-establish a widespread legal
system on the basis of Roman law and the deliberate attempts to
establish the primacy of papal power over temporal power or vice
versa; but it also includes demographic and economic changes, like
those identified by the Marxists, that no one in particular had in
their control. Tierney, Grossi, and Coleman are excellent at keeping
these changes in mind as they explain theoretical shifts, but I will
also rely directly on economic and social histories of the period.

Unfortunately, historians of medieval political theory have usually
addressed _dominium_ only as one aspect of changing political
postures, and none of them have attempted to tell a more systematic
story about _dominium_ itself. For that reason, none of them have
thematized and traced the specific shift that interests me--the
emergence of the idea of private property as a subjective natural
right.

The historians who have thematized that shift, and who initially put
me onto this line of inquiry, are not concerned directly with property
either but with the idea of natural rights--thinkers like Brian
Tierney, Richard Tuck, Annabel Brett, and Virpi MÃ¤kinen. Property
(_dominium_ or _proprietas_) is important to them because of the way
it gets joined to the shifting meaning of "right" (_ius_) beginning in
the 12th century. Where _ius_ had traditionally borne a strictly
objective meaning--"that which is just"--it slowly took on a
subjective meaning, too. _Ius_ came also to designate a rightful claim
a person has over something. In its subjective meaning, _ius_ began to
look like a kind of lordship, or _dominium_, and the terms were
quickly elided. It's partly owing to the elision between _ius_ and
_dominium_ that the latter came to be seen as natural at all.

The painstaking work done by these historians, especially in tracing
the complicated evolution of key legal terms, will be a central
resource for my own argument. But since, as I say, their attention to
property is only ancillary to their real concern with the idea of
natural rights in general, I will have to expand on their analysis
significantly. Expanding it will mean, above all, attending in more
detail to a phenomenon they all recognize as important but say very
little about: the explosion of poverty movements in the 12th and 13th
centuries, and especially the massive success of the Franciscan order.

On my reading, the Franciscans are the heart of this story. The idea
of the right to property was neither a mechanical consequence of
changes in the mode of production nor an invention of legal theorists
(though both of those factors were crucial); it was, paradoxically,
the outcome of a series of attempts to _critique_ the emerging
capitalist order and to put it on a more ethical path.

The last century has seen a lot of lively debate about how to
interpret Franciscan origins, beginning with Paul Sabatier's _Life of
St Francis of Assisi_ in 1893. The biggest questions have focused on
the early years of Francis's _fraternitas_. How did a predominantly
lay community committed to manual labor and care for local lepers become
an incredibly wealthy, well-connected, self-consciously clerical order
within the two decades between Francis's 'conversion' and his death?
What were the effects of that "metamorphosis" on the original ideals of
_paupertas_ and _minoritas_?

On a historiographical level, the question of particular interest to
me is how to interpret the political significance of the Order and its
development. The standard position right now (clearly reflected, for
example, in Grado Merlo's wildly influential _Nel nome di San
Francesco_) is that Francis himself was an essentially apolitical
figure, and that only in its metamorphosis did Franciscanism become a
political force--and then especially on behalf of papal power. My
project aims to complicate that view, above all by placing Francis's
own original conversion in the context of the poverty movements that
had been taking place over the previous century.

But even granting that there's an important sense in which Francis
himself was a political figure, the real question is what kind of
political perspective he represented and what effect the Order's
metamorphosis had on that perspective. The real question for me, more
specifically, is: _what political perspective is implicit in the
Franciscan commitment to voluntary poverty as the form of that
commitment develops?_ A number of excellent studies have been produced
on the debates over and theories of evangelical poverty in the 13th
and 14th centuries, most notably Malcolm Lambert's _Franciscan
Poverty_ and Roberto Lambertini's _PovertÃ  Pensata_, but without
bringing those ideas into contact with broader socioeconomic
changes. More directly relevant are the essays in _PauvretÃ© et
capitalisme_ (ed. Luca Parisoli) and Giacomo Todeschini's _Richezza
francescana_, which advance arguments more nearly in line with my own:
that the Franciscan movement, far from being apolitical or politically
irrelevant, had unexpected and decisive consequences on the trajectory
of European politics.

The historian who has done more than anyone to bring these various
questions together is Lester Little, especially in his _Religious
Poverty and the Profit Economy in Medieval Europe_. That book is one
of the original inspirations for this project. Little is more
concerned with sociocultural than with intellectual history, and
attends to a much wider group of new religious movements than just the
Franciscans; but he, too, tries to explain those movements as attempts
to grapple with changing economic conditions. I will rely extensively
on Little's work, while focusing on a more specific line on
inquiry--the development of a specific political concept--within the
framework he lays out.


# Method

There are two key methodological questions I'll face in trying to make
the kind of argument I propose to make in this dissertation. The
first, with respect to the project's historical aspect, is how to
understand the relation between intellectual and political or social
history. The second, with respect to its constructive aspect, is how
historical narrative can inform contemporary debate.

1\. In contemporary discussions of the history of private property,
there is a tendency to focus exclusively on one side or the other:
either socioeconomic development (the Marxists) or intellectual
development (the theologians). I've already begun to say why I think
that's a substantive mistake on this particular issue; my contention
is that the right to property arises as a result of a _religious and
intellectual response_ to _changing socioeconomic conditions_. But I
think it's a mistake at the methodological level, too. Even if I'm
mainly concerned with the emergence of a particular _idea_, I have to
be attentive to its broader material context.

The question is, what's the specific relation between an idea and its
context? That question has provoked endless debate, and I hope to
dig more deeply into that debate as I work through my argument. For
now, I'll simply state my working position and the consequences for
how I deal with my sources.

Ideas, I believe, are profoundly dependent on context, even where
those who articulate them aren't aware of it. They are always enmeshed
in complicated, social, largely unconscious networks of reference and
meaning that are simultaneously discursive (drawing on religious
traditions, cultural traditions in general, dominant social
descriptions, etc.) and empirical (specified by actually available
points of reference: the particular forms taken by wealth, poverty,
work, and so on in a given thinker's situation). Ideas are always
articulated _in negotiation_ with those networks of meaning,
explicitly and implicitly, intentionally and unintentionally. Grasping
the significance of a particular idea involves grasping those
negotiations--if not all of them, which is obviously impossible, at
least those ones which are most relevant to the question at
hand. That's why it's a mistake to read single text in isolation from
its discursive context, and also a mistake to read _only texts_ in
isolation from their practical significance.

What this means for me, for example, is that Franciscan accounts of
voluntary poverty need to be read not only in the context of the
debates to which they explicitly belonged (with other mendicants, and
with secular or papal critics), but also in contexts they sometimes
explicitly disavow but which nonetheless directly bear on the concrete
meaning of their ideas (their significance for the involuntarily poor,
or for ecclesiastical ownership). I also can't assume that the meaning
of the ideas I'm dealing with is transparent. Claims about
"stewardship" need to be understood in light of actually-existing
structures of distribution; "poverty," obviously, needs to be
understood in light of actual levels of access to and control over
means of subsistence. Thus the importance of the social histories I'll
rely on while working through the primary sources.

The usual concern with such a strong emphasis on the dependence of
ideas on their context is reductionism. But I assume that in entering
into negotiation with their cultural or political context, thinkers
are capable of real creativity. In fact, my argument depends on the
possibility that the poverty movements could have responded to their
changing social conditions in a genuinely new way, producing a new way
of thinking about those conditions and so new ways of _changing_
them. But that's different than reading history as if ideas arise in a
purely philosophical context, or as if thinkers are always conscious
of the full 'objective' significance of what they say. My goal is to
always to be aware of what's being left unsaid, intentionally or
unintentionally, because it's assumed or because it's suppressed,
while giving maximum credence to what people are trying to do or
express within their given context.

2\. The second key methodological problem I'll face is how a historical
narrative can inform constructive work. My position on the relation
between ideas and historical context makes this problem particularly
complex, since the medieval Franciscan idea of property, for example,
would be irreducibly medieval and Franciscan, constituted in a network
of problems and realities that are no longer ours. It seems
impossible, if that's true, to reclaim older intellectual
possibilities in any very straightforward sense.

There has been less explicit methodological reflection on this question
than it deserves, and I hope to use this project an opportunity to
develop my own thinking on the matter further. For now, again, I can
only outline my working position.

In the first place, I believe that part of the constructive usefulness
of history comes precisely from its difference. With the benefit of
hindsight, it is possible to see the intricate structure of
relationships between ideas and people and institutions and so on much
more clearly than we can see those relationships as they exist for us,
now. But identifying a certain relationship in the past might clarify
analogical relationships in the present. For example, if it turns out
that in the 13th and 14th centuries the right to private property
emerged partly as a defense of the political status of the poor (as I
will argue it did), that might suggest new ways of thinking about that
right in our own day.

The key term, I think, is analogical. The awareness of older ideas
or practices can inspire analogical ideas or practices in the
present, and the awareness of older structures of relation can make us
aware of analogical structures of relation in the present. But making
the analogy requires careful attention on both ends of the
comparison. When an old idea is directly 'reclaimed'--as happens, I
would argue, in Catholic social teaching on the universal destination
of goods or on the medieval guild structure--it often ends up either
ineffective or counterproductive, even destructive.

On a more general level, telling the history of an idea or institution
also helps to relativize its current forms. Especially in light of the
widespread assumption in the contemporary U.S. that the right to
private property is fixed, natural, structural to human existence,
simply telling part of the history of that very idea can help open the
way towards alternative economic proposals.


# Constructive implications

A huge variety of constructive questions will inevitably come up as I
work through the historical material. There will be broad political
questions, for examples, about the status of human law, about the
relation of political power and property-ownership, about the very
idea of spiritual power and its relation to temporal power. And there
will be theological questions about the legitimacy of speaking of God
as a property-owner, about whether private property belongs only to
our fallenness, and about what role an alternative vision of innocence
or paradise should play in our political imagination. I will not try
to pronounce on these questions, of course, but as I explain their
importance to the medieval debates, I do hope to raise them _as
constructive questions_. One of the most important contributions a
study of the medieval debates can make to the contemporary
conversation is to expand the range and complexity of questions we're
currently asking about private property.

One bigger constructive question, however, constitutes the real
beating heart of this project: _where do we go with private property
today?_ At a formal level, I want to show that the way we tell the
history of private property partly determines the options we think we
have. But the main constructive point I anticipate trying to make is
that the right to private property is _ambiguous_ both as an idea and
as an institution.

Like many others recently, I'm skeptical that private property should
be counted as an imperturbable right; I think it's important to find
ways to make private ownership conditional on satisfying collective
demands. (Practically, that would mean _at minimum_ a stricter and
more consistent progressive tax code; ideally, it would involve
experimenting with forms of economic democracy that spread out the
control of capital. The forms that would have to take under
post-Fordism aren't as clear as they were in the heyday of big
industry, but they are by no means unimaginable.) I would go further,
in fact, and say that 'the right to private property'--however
regulated or circumscribed--has outlived its day as a core principle
of our economic system. By returning to the point at which a right to
private property was only just being articulated, I think I can show
that the idea was originally used to _rule out_ experimentation in
forms of collective obligation. Efforts to protect the common good by
reinforcing private property rights may sometimes work, but only by
bending the concept against itself.

On the other hand, returning to the point at which a right to private
property was first articulated brings its _usefulness_ into sharper
relief. The right to private property arose, along with a general
affirmation of an individual zone of autonomy, as a way of protecting
individuals against unjust interference by other structures of
authority. It came to provide a legal shield for tenant farmers
against exorbitant demands by their landlords, and paradoxically, in
the so-called rights of necessity, enabled the poor to take what they
needed from the rich when no other options were available. In
situations of need and exploitation, the principle of the right to
private property (as with all human rights) continues to serve that
function today. The problem is that it doesn't _only_ serve that
function, and has also became the basis for greater and greater forms
of exploitation.

The task that thus emerges is to begin thinking about new ways of
characterizing our relations to things, and new ways of protecting
individuals against unjust interference, that simultaneously involve
us in protecting the common good. This is where we come into unmarked
territory, and it becomes difficult to know how to move
forward. Generally, the way forward will come slowly and haphazardly
into view through political experiments rather than through
theory. But I think the medieval situation can provide examples of
past political experimentation, _and_ ways of thinking through the
possibilities, that can provoke real progress in our own day. These
will arise naturally as I work through the source material.

# Structure
 
Let me turn, finally, to the structure and specifics of my
argument. 

## Introduction: Private Property and the Fall

I will open the dissertation by providing a maximally contrastive
account of the theology of property that held in the early church and
through the early Middle Ages. This chapter will inevitably be
somewhat impressionistic, as my goal will be to identify the most
important consensus features of the earlier position rather than
attend to the differences between thinkers. I will emphasize three
features above all: that private property belonged exclusively to the
world as fallen, that private property was a human construct (whereas
'naturally' all would have been held in common, with God as the one
true _dominus_), and that social obligations placed important limits
on the private use of property. But I will illustrate these assertions
in close readings of relevant selections from Ambrose, Augustine, John
Chrysostom, and finally--to illustrate the basic theological
continuity between the patristic and the medieval period on this
question--Gratian.

## Chapter 1: The Death of a Paradigm

There are two main conditions for the birth of the right to private
property in the 13th and 14th centuries. The first condition is the
changing socioeconomic landscape: the rise and impending fall of
feudalism, and the re-introduction of a widespread money
economy. Those shifts raised new questions that the traditional
account of property couldn't easily answer. The second condition is
the birth of the voluntary poverty movements in the 12th and 13th
centuries. I will narrate some of the early (i.e., pre-Franciscan)
history of these movements, positioning them as reactions against and
as new attempts to come to terms with the emerging socioeconomic
conditions. Many of the participants were met with charges of heresy,
and often also with violence. Breaking with a more traditional vision
of sanctity as that encroached on economic life (largely because that
vision no longer tracked actual economic conditions) was perceived as,
and partly was, a critique of the institutional church itself. The
critique of property implied in the shape of these movements was
theologically continuous with the critique leveled by earlier figures,
but the form had been adapted--and had regained a serious critical
efficacy.


## Chapter 2: The Political Edge of the Franciscan Ideal

It's in the context of these broader socioeconomic changes and events
that the "official" poverty movements, above all the Franciscans, need
to be understood. Even though Francis never framed his agenda in
overtly political terms, the ideals of his _fraternitas_ had direct
political significance from the very beginning. Their political
significance became clearer and more explicit as the movement grew and
changed. By the 1320's, the Franciscans are deeply engaged in the
first of their many debates over rigorism and compromise. The Order
emerges from those debates with their commitment to Francis's ideals
still intact, but framed in a significantly different way. The
political challenge implicit in Francis's original vision is not
entirely eliminated, but it is transformed. I will focus especially on
Francis's own texts, above all the Rule(s) and the Testament, in order
to explain his vision; and I will focus on the writings of Gregory IX
in order to illustrate the alternative interpretation of the Order's
ideals that achieved dominance in the second decade of the Order's
existence. Debates about the political significance of Francis and his
order also appear regularly in the historiography of Franciscan
origins, so I will engage those questions throughout this chapter.


## Chapter 3: Voluntary Poverty as a Critical Principle

The commitment to voluntary poverty had deep political significance,
too, and it was beset by the same tensions as other parts of the
Franciscan vision. Francis himself connects voluntary poverty to
precarity, disempowerment, and solidarity with the involuntarily
poor. Those aspects are downplayed or even positively ruled out,
however, as the Order grows more clerical and more mainstream. Later
accounts of Franciscan poverty concentrate instead on poverty as a
posture of humility or spiritual detachment, and--most importantly for
my project--as a specific legal category that excludes all property
rights. I will track that shift through Gregory IX's _Quo elongati_
(1230), Bonaventure's _Questiones de perfectione evangelica_ (1256)
and _Apologia pauperum_ (1269), and Nicholas III's _Exiit qui seminat_
(1274), among others. 

Yet I want to resist characterizing that shift as a simple
loss or abandonment of Francis's original spirit, as is so often
done. On the contrary, the debates that arise as the Order becomes
more mainstream also end up writing some of Francis's original ideals
into the broader political consciousness. That happens both by getting
opponents of the Order to adopt key Franciscan presuppositions (as
happens in William of Saint-Amour's sermons) and by getting
Franciscans themselves to deal with questions of mainstream concern
(as happens for example in the work of John Duns Scotus).

The culminating argument of this chapter will be that the definition
of evanglical poverty the Franciscans ultimately canonize--as
renouncing all but _usus simplex facti_--crystallizes the ambiguity of
the Order's development. On the one hand, it severs any remaining ties
to the practical shape of Francis's own poverty; on the other, it
enshrines at a legal level the possibility the poverty movements had
been fighting for from the beginning: the ability to opt out of the
emerging money economy, and refuse its totalizing impulse. 


## Chapter 4: Self-ownership and the Right of Necessity

In this chapter, I turn to the changing understanding of _dominium_
within legal and political theory more broadly, and in particular on
the concepts of _self-ownership_ and _the right of necessity_. The
development of these concepts clearly reveals the gradual
'naturalization' or 'universalization' of private property underway in
this same period. The idea that all human beings have _dominium_ over
themselves helps lay the philosophical groundwork for a natural right
to private property, and the idea that all human beings have a right
to claim what they need in moments of necessity begins to imagine a
concrete institutional form for that right. Both ideas become
recurring points of reference in legal theory, especially in the
latter half of the 13th century. And surprisingly, mendicant thinkers
play an important role in the way they develop. The commitment to
voluntary poverty bears fruit in these broader conversations about
property.

The first part of this chapter will focus on Gratian and the early
canonists. I will review territory mapped by Brian Tierney and Richard
Tuck around the changing relation between _ius_ and _dominium_, but
giving primary focus to the latter. The second part of the chapter
will focus especially on Franciscan scholasticism, trying to identify
the particular shifts forced by the commitment to voluntary
poverty. I'm not yet familiar enough with these texts to name those
shifts in much detail, but I expect to find two general patterns that
stand in tension with one another: movement away from the idea that
private property is necessary even in a sinful world, and movement
towards the idea that private property can protect a fundamental need
of human beings to control the basic conditions of their own
existence. In other words, the mendicant theorists simultaneously
develop a way of opting out of private property and a rationale for
guaranteeing private property for everyone. It's this tension, I will
suggest, that opens the door for John XXII's condemnation of the
Franciscan poverty ideal in the 14th century.


## Chapter 5: The Birth of the Right to Private Property

Finally, I will turn to focus on the debates between the Franciscans
and John XXII in the second and third decades of the 14th
century. It's in the course of these debates that John, on both
theological and legal grounds, first clearly articulates the idea of a
natural right to private property. John draws on certain
'naturalizing' trends already present in the Franciscan understanding
of private property, but he does so precisely in order to condemn the
Franciscan position. Instead of talking about a right to claim the
conditions of one's existence, John talks about a general juridical
right to "use and ab-use" goods. And he declares the claim to opt out
of the private property system heretical, thus tearing in half the
tension maintained by the Franciscans and ruling out their kind of
economic critique and experimentation.

By the end of this chapter, I hope to be able to articulate two
things. First, I want to explain John XXII's understanding of the
right to private property in a way that current readers can recognize
as profoundly similar to their own. That will give the reader implicit
confirmation (to be made explicit in the next chapter) that this
tangled history does in fact give rise to an understanding of property
that still dominates the contemporary imagination. Second, I want to
state as clearly as possible the _ambiguity_ involved in the earliest
formulations of the right to private property. That will call into
question in advance the simple decline narrative told by many
theologians, and prepare the ground for the more complicated position
I want to take in the final chapter.


## Conclusion: The Franciscan Legacy

Although it isn't immediate or absolute, the Johannine understanding
of private property does ultimately gain intellectual supremacy over
the next several centuries. It's clearest in the case of John Locke,
the principle theorist of the property system we in the United States
have inherited. Locke's famous fifth chapter of the _Second Treatise_,
devoted to the nature of private property, stands in complex but very
clear continuity with the medieval controversies and especially with
John XXII's position. Situating Locke in the older debates will give
me an opportunity to make some schematic suggestions about what those
debates can illumine in our own political situation.
