# Notes

I started thinking about this essay while reading bell hooks's
_Killing Rage_. I want to use it as a way to work through my sympathy
for a certain kind of revolutionary violence, or, even without the
goal of revolution, the violent expression of rage against
oppressors. I'm not actually sure if this unseats an absolute
commitment to nonviolence for me or not, and I'd rather avoid making
such a dirent statement in the essay. But I do want to say that the
commitment to nonviolence often comes bundled with a refusal of
rage--not just righteous anger, but rage--and that we need to
disconnect those. Rage is good. Rage is, as hooks says, a passionate
expression of subjectivity against those who deny subjectivity.

hooks also talks about the dangers of claiming victimhood as a more
socially acceptable alternative to rage, because it strips you of
subjectivity, it accepts the mantle of passivity. The ideology of
nonviolence has often done the same thing: the only way to convince
the public of the righteousness of our cause is to be absolutely
passive in the face of violence. We have to allow ourselves to be
arrested, we have to allow the cops to beat us, etc. Otherwise, the
media will read resistance as cause of the police violence. This is
what happened over and over again in the Occupy movements. It's also
what happened in the Black Power movement. And it's true that the
media interprets all expressions of rage as sufficient cause for
violent suppression. But it's also true that the demand to stay on the
receiving end of violence without any active expression of rage is
de-subjectifying.
