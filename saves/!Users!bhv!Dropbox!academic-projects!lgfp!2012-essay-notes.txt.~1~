# Notes on others' reflection papers

## Devin Byker

* Cleverness vs. kindness?
* "Kindness in scholarship, then, is a form of recognition, and, in
  that recognition, an enabling of the pull possibilities of our
  mutual work and conversations."
* Recognition among scholars, recognition with regard to subject
  matter.
  
## Paul Camacho

* Religion concerned with intimacy, philosophy with universality; but
  both are concerned with _ultimacy_.
* "My attraction to pre-modern philospohy has everything to do with
  the fact that the pre-modern ethos was one which allowed the
  intimate ultimacy of religious faith to permeate and nourish a life
  of philosophical wonder."
* Dissertation project: freedom beyond autonomy, because autonomy
  comes coupled with a devaluation of being and nature.
  
## Joel Davis

* "Teaching is a type of performing."

## Amanda Dykema

* "There is a part of me that remains convinced that if people I love
  and trust from both realms [the world of Christian faith and the
  world of academic scholarship] knew my inner thoughts, they would
  confront me, as Meg's principle does: 'Don't you realize that you
  just make everything harder for yourself by your attitude?
  ... You're going to have to do something about yourself. Nobody can
  do it for you."
