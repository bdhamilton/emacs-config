# Notes for presentation of 'Detachment' paper

My main points were:

1. The relation between faith and scholarship is simpler for
   theologians, in the obvious way. I study my faith, and I study it
   because it is my faith.
2. In the guild, it's almost mandatory that scholarship be motivated
   by faith as a living commitment.
3. My college experience was one of trying to connect faith and
   theological scholarship as close as humanly possible. "Scholarship"
   was basically defined for me as "thinking through the implications
   of your faith as rigorously as possible," and "faith" was defined
   as "putting those implications immediately into action."
   * That turned out to be bad.  
4. _Gelassenheit_. Freeing faith to be faith and scholarship to be
   scholarship. Neither controls the other. Neither should try to
   control the other.
5. It's counterintuitive, but I think theologians need to work
   especially hard to achieve what Christian scholars in other
   disciplines have naturally and what appears, from one perspective,
   like a disadvantage: a disconnect between what they study and what
   they put their faith in.
   
   
## How to present this to the group:

Susan said to present the five most important points from our papers,
so here are my five points:

1. The relation between faith and scholarship looks simpler for
   theologians, and in one sense it is simpler. What I study is my
   faith, and I came to study it because it was my faith. A lot of
   Christian scholars--including theologians--talk as if this was the
   ideal situation. The measure of the Christian-ness of scholarship
   is how directly you can speak of God or of faith, even if you have
   to route that concern through literature or art or music or
   whatever. You should be trying to give witness to God in all
   things. Theologians just get to say that out loud.
2.
