Okay, let's try this again. I'm already getting distracted by fiddling
with my emacs setup rather than doing the things I really need to be
doing. I stayed up late last night, too, like I always do when I'm
alone. I'd like to live on a slightly more normal, or at least a
slightly more healthy schedule than I usually do when left to my own
devices. I have two weeks, very few friends, which means a lot of wide
open time. There's also a lot to get done. I don't feel stressed,
which is good, because I don't want to feel stressed, but if I don't
keep life in a decent order rather than just sitting around the
apartment watching TV all day, I will find myself stressed and
disappointed in myself at the beginning of next week, when everything
needs to be finished up before I leave.

That's the biggest thing for right now. Make sure you know what you
need to be doing over the next two weeks, and get it done relatively
methodically. Do not, I repeat DO NOT, leave everything to the last
few days. You should be making progress on house cleaning, packing,
seeing the last few things you want to see here every day. That means
that today and tomorrow you need to spend serious time getting
everything in order. It may feel like a waste of time, but it's
not. Today you need to clean the apartment; that will be a good place
to start. You need to re-organize your org files, BUT DON'T SPEND TOO
MUCH TIME ON THAT. More than anything else, you need to get the org
files in place so you can actually start DOING what you need to be
doing.

I've been feeling insecure about Melissa, but I need to stop. Fuck
it. She's back home with her family, David's sick, Melissa's still a
little traumatized (as I imagine the whole family is). I need to give
her as much space as possible. Stop telling her you miss her. Stop
emailing her too much. Act like an adult. Are there things you need to
know? Fine. Keep her up to date on your life, because it's fine to
keep acting like she wants to know. But don't beg for details on her
side. She'll give what she feels like giving.

Anything else that's on my mind this morning? Not really. A dire need
for organization, and a little bit of insecurity about Melissa. I'm
feeling glad to be on my own again after the Assisi trip, glad not to
feel self-conscious or scrutinized, glad not to be speaking Italian
this morning. My brain has needed a rest. (That's probably a stupid
thing to say, and it's been a stupid excuse to use while I was there,
too. I'm a little disappointed in myself for not having tried more
intensely to keep myself immersed in the language. Oh well. I got a
good bit better anyway.

Okay, I'm going to get some breakfast and start in on some of these
chores.

Spent the day recuperating from the seminar in Assisi. Cleaned the
apartment, organized myself, fiddled with Emacs, watched _The Social
Network_.

**** Morning pages
It's a bit late to be writing my daily pages, but I'm out of the habit
and I completely forgot. I got up and did the first few things on my
to do list this morning, but then got distracted again with Emacs and
now it's 11am. I haven't showered or left the house or anything. Ay. I
do get a bit frustrated with myself when I do this. I love the idea of
being able to program, and I really enjoy messing around with this
stuff, but just like it did in high school, it kind of takes over my
life and I end up doing nothing else useful. I can't let that
happen. I want to learn lisp and python, I want to be able to hack
Emacs, I want to be able to write iOS programs, etc., but I need to
find a way of doing it that doesn't absolutely destroy my time, eating
into all the other things that I want to do--not just as a hobby, but
as a central part of my life. Like, you know, have friends and write
philosophy. There are a million other things I'm supposed to be doing
today. Okay, maybe not a million, but I'm way behind on my reading for
book club and I have two pieces from friends waiting for comments and
revision. It'd be nice to get those done, you know, to be reliable and
helpful, but instead I'm here trying to figure out how to check my
email through Emacs.

I remember the first time I tried seriously to learn Emacs. Well,
"seriously." It only lasted about a week, I think. But the problem was
that I tried to learn almost everything at once, and it got too
overwhelming. I tried to make Emacs run everything right out of the
box. I tried to sync it to gmail and google calendar, I tried to use
to write and to convert all my writing to other formats, I tried to
run a web browser out of it... And it can do all those things, but
there's just too much to learn. It's a complex program. Things have
been going better this time because I've been keeping it much
simpler. Learn the keystrokes. Learn org-mode. Write in Markdown like
you already have been. Make minor tweaks when they're available, but
don't push too hard. Now if I can start learning Elisp, I'll be able
to understand the configuration files and minor tweaks, and
eventually, I'll be able to make my own tweaks. The Emacs world seems
like a really good place to learn how to hack, especially because as
an Emacs user in the humanities, I'm a little bit of an oddity, and
there will be a handful of things that will be helpful to me that
might not have been developed yet. It's an active and helpful world,
it gives the Lisp I learn an immediate practical application,
etc. etc.

But I've gotta get some other things done today.

Spent the day editing Ben's first proposal draft and catching up with family and friends.

**** Morning pages
Okay, doing this really late again. I feel like it should be the first
thing I do when I get up, to make sure that I'm going the least
reflective part of the day. After an hour of being awake, exercising,
making breakfast, etc., etc., there's a whole new set of things
preoccupying me, and I almost can't remember the things I had on my
mind last night, or in my dreams.

I do remember my dreams, this time. I remember one, long, drawn-out
dream, that repeated several times. I was participating in some kind
of trust exercise with Melissa where I had to lower her down the side
of a building with a rope harness and pulley. The first time I tried I
ended up pulling on the wrong section of rope, which just kept getting
longer and longer and longer, and I pulled farther and farther and
farther back from the building trying to reach the point where it
would catch, and I would be able to support her weight. Finally
someone corrected me, and gave me control of the right segment of
rope--but then Melissa didn't trust me, and couldn't bear to start
clibming down the side of the building.

I do think that the situation with Melissa is bothering my
subconscious more than anything else right now. I don't really know
what to do about it. She just feels distant, uncaring. I think I'm
doing the only thing I can do, which is leave her alone to with her
family. She's definitely been feeling smothered in this apartment,
which, fine, I can't blame her for. Different people react to
different situations differently. The last time she and I talked about
this, we both said she was probaby suffering from some low level form
of depression. I think there's more than that, but I don't want to go
into it right now. Anyway, there's nothing to do but to give her a bit
of space, treat her well, and keep living me life. Honestly, some of
this is good for me, because it's forcing me to refocus my attention
on myself a bit--in a constructive rather than self-gnawing doubt kind
of way.

I'm really, really enjoying playing with Emacs and learning a bit of
Lisp. I don't know why I've gotten back into this with such a
vengeance. Like I said yesterday, I think, I just need to make sure I
keep it under control. I've already spent a bit of time this morning
fiddling with my .emacs, to join my morning and evening journal
entries into one file rather than having them separate. In a way,
Emacs does contribute to one of my worst procrastination
habits--always organizing and preparing, never actually doing the
things I really want to do.

But it's really not true! I'm writing my morning pages right now. I've
got an ambitious todo list nicely staked out for the day. Now let's
just do it.
**** Evening sentences
Worked through Angela's proposal draft, now, and watched an
embarrassing amount of the show 'Penn & Teller: Fool Us.'

**** Morning pages
What a terrible night of sleep. No, no, that's not really fair. It was
my fault. I was up until 4 o'clock in the morning, for God's sake,
watching stupid magic videos. God that's embarrassing to write. Again,
what an abysmal lack of self-control. I went to bed at 4 o'clock, and
then of course didn't sleep terribly well--not only because it's
impossible to sleep well when you go to bed that late, but also
because it was so hot, and in order to make sure I got any sleep at
all, I had to close the windows to the apartment. So I woke up a
million and one times. Now it's 9:45, I just woke up, and I'm
completely disgusted with myself.

Let's see if I can make it up by doing a little better today at, you
know, life. I should leave the apartment. I should do better on my to
do list. I should make real food for lunch and dinner. (Yesterday I
had a salad for lunch, but pizza for dinner. And a ridiculous amount
of cookies over the course of the day.)

The biggest thing is going to be that I need to get back into writing
today. I need to get cracking on that dissertation proposal, and I
need to make some real progress on my LGFP paper. But I also have a
bunch of errands I've been saving up to run, and I need to stop
putting those off. I especially need to get all these books back to
their respective libraries, before I have the whole city after me.

I'm tired of this heat. I was just crossing my legs, and then
uncrossed them, and there's just a pool of sweat where my ankle was
resting on my thigh. A bit of a air conditioning would do me extremely
well.

I'm also starting to feel a little gross, because I've been eating and
sleeping so poorly. Seriously, Brian, pull it together, huh?
**** Evening sentences
I just veged out all day today, except for a little bit of time
learning how to back palm a coin and a quick grocery run.

**** Morning pages
At least I went to bed a bit earlier last night, around midnight,
after a long day of doing nothing. And then I slept for almost 10
hours. It's really strange to me that I do this kind of thing. It
feels so hard to pick myself up and leave the house, to stop watching
TV or stop browsing the web, even though I don't actually enjoy myself
when I veg out like that. I feel disgusting. Why is it so hard to do
the things I actually enjoy, the things that actually make me happy?
It's not just a moral thing, either; I mean, it's not just like on
some primal level I really enjoy watching eight hours of television,
but intellectually I think I shouldn't. No, I physically feel gross
right now, and even on the primal level I enjoy writing, for example,
more than I enjoy watching Penn & Teller. I guess it's not that I
don't enjoy the little things I do on these veg out days; I like
watching MasterChef, for example; but doing it non stop just destroys
me.

Anyway, I turned off internet in the apartment before I went to bed
last night, so let's see if that helps me this morning. It's easy to
turn back on, of course, but just not having it there, I hope, will
keep me from running down a side road I don't come back from.

I'm going to have to reschedule a lot of what I had expected to do,
now. I'm behind, and it'll take a bit to catch up. Probably better to
think about it as starting from scratch. I have eight days left to do
everything I need to do before leaving Bologna. 

Shit, that's crazy. Time's almost up.

My mind's going a little wild now, thinking about that. I'm thinking
about all the little things that still have to be done, all the people
I've met here, all the things I'd like to do but haven't done, all the
things I've done I'm glad I did.
**** Evening sentences
Last trip, I expect, to the Unibo libraries today--to turn in all the
library books I still had around the apartment. Got back into writing
my proposal, and remembered how much I enjoy that work.
*** 2012-07-12 Thursday
**** Morning pages
Woke up a bit stressed out, or a bit sad, and I'm not completely sure
why. Part of it is just feeling the time ticking away: I need to
prioritize making some progress on the apartment, so I don't leave
everything to the last few days. I really need to take Melissa's
sweater to that repair shop, if I'm not already too late. That's one
is gnawing on me in particular.

The sadness, though, comes from somewhere else. I dreamed about a lot
of friends last night, all girls, from different parts of my
life. Caite White was there, Sarah Downey (Flasher) was there, Melissa
was there, Alexandra was there... There were others. I remember almost
nothing from the dream. There was some kind of performance, I think,
or a class of some kind, that I was supposed to be going to but
skipped so I could go down to a nearby town, and gradually I saw them
all, and we all ended up hanging out. I think it might partly be a
loneliness dream. Melissa's definitely faded out; I get almost nothing
from her. I talked to Todd for a long time last night, which was fun,
but... I don't know. I still feel lonely. I talk to Todd so much it
doesn't count; sometimes it almost feels like an act of service rather
than friendship.

Anyway, though, these things don't need to weigh me down today. I need
to take Melissa's sweater to be repaired, I need to email Elizabeth
just to catch up rather than for GTS business, and then I need to
double down on all the things I want/need to get done before I leave
this place. I'm up a little earlier today, 8:20, which feels
better. Bed's made, coffee's on, internet's off, I'm ready to go.

Cleared and cleaned out the kitchen cabinets today; starting to close
down the apartment.
*** 2012-07-13 Friday
**** Morning pages
The first thing I did this morning (after, that is, I woke up a little
before 8, checked the clock, and went back to sleep for another hour)
is make my bed and then do a little bit more cleaning on the
apartment. Finishing things I meant to be finishing yesterday. Because
yesterday afternoon, at least, was once again a gigantic waste of
time. But let's stop dwelling on that: the point is, it actually felt
good to get up and do a bit of cleaning. It's hard to know if there
are other parts of the apartment I can really do that with, though,
because I still have a little under a week here which means I still
have to live in the place a while longer. The apartment is small
enough that there aren't many places I don't have to touch. The
kitchen cabinets are maybe the only one, now that I've pulled out all
the remaining food and put it on the desk. (I'm hoping that having it
all out there will also help me see what there is and _use it_, rather
than going out and spending money on meals and then throwing it all
away.)

What am I thinking about this morning? There is a hint of shame about
yesterday afternoon and evening, but like I say, I don't really want
to dwell on that.

I'm thinking about my beard right now. This is day eight without
shaving, which I really do think is the longest I've ever gone--since
late high school or whatever, obviously. I figured this is the best
chance I have to see what it looks like to start growing it out, since
Melissa's gone and I know almost nobody here. I'm not sure I like
it. And it's definitely really itchy and annoying right now. I was on
the verge of shaving it off yesterday, but again, I figured this was
the only time I had to give it a go so what the hell. I haven't looked
at myself in the mirror yet today. We'll see what I think. It's
definitely still itchy, though.

Am I ready to go home? I have been really ready to go home, for weeks
and weeks now. But really I'm ready to go _home_, to South Bend, to
Notre Dame, to friends and to a more normal life with Melissa. I'm not
sure I'm ready to handle several weeks at Melissa's family's
house. And I admit I'm a little nervous to see Melissa, too, since I
just feel like things have been changing and she's been enjoying my
absence and so it'll be hard to know how to act. But in this kind of
context, I really don't enjoy being alone, either, because I can't
manage myself. I need a little accountability. At least going back
will be helpful for that.

There's still a minute left in my morning pages, and I'm not sure what
what I should write about. I'm thinking about making coffee and I'm
trying to decide whether I should do some pushups. I probably
should. I'm not sore anymore. But I've been messing with my schedule
and now it's not clear. I should probably just put the schedule back
the way it was. Yeah. I'll do that.

Chipped away at the dissertation and at emptying out the apartment.

The absolute worst feeling, the feeling that really sent me into
depression last fall, and the feeling that I'm feeling right now, is
the feeling that I'm failing to do things out of pure fear and
laziness. Two things especially that I've been putting off and now
simply can't do any longer, both for Melissa: getting her sweater
repaired and getting the bra that she had accidentally dropped onto
the balcony below ours while trying to hang it out to dry. It's too
late on the sweater because there's not time to have it repaired
anymore, and I haven't already done it because I chickened out about
having to make a stupid phone call in Italian. It's too late on the
bra, as of this morning, because it's no longer sitting on the balcony
below ours: someone finally picked it up and threw it away. It's just
this huge feeling of failure. I'd been psyching myself up to go down and
knock on the people's door as recently as last night while I was
falling asleep, and I'd been excited about having done something that
would surprise Melissa and that would make her happy, and now it's
done. Because I'm too fucking scared to make a phone call or knock on
a door. It just makes feel like such a total loser. It makes me feel
incompetent. It makes me feel like I should just hide.

This is something I've been learning about myself gradually over the
past year, but something I need to really buckle down on making a
habit: I must, I absolutely must, identify those things on my to do
list I'm most afraid of and _do them first_, because otherwise they're
going to eat at me and keep me from doing anything else.

It's not necessarily a matter of afraid of. For example, I also avoid
things I already feel behind on. And then avoiding them makes me feel
more behind, and feeling more behind makes me avoid it more, and then
I never do it an embarrass myself. The thing I'm thinking of right now
is book club for Ben. I'm about 110 pages behind right now, and I have
read literally _not one page_ this week. Every day I've promised I'd
start catching up, and I haven't even opened the book (or the PDF, in
this case). And it makes me feel bad, because besides actually wanting
to read the book, I want to be doing this with Ben, and when I don't
keep up it feels to me (and I think sometimes, especially after long
streaks like I've been on, it also feels to him) like I'm just not
that interested in what we're doing together.

So that's one of the things I need to prioritize today. The other task
is just to go through my to do list and gauge my inner reactions to
other tasks. The other thing that's coming to mind is the jaunt over
to the kitchen store to try to replace the lamp and the soapdish I've
broken here. In that case it's not even a particularly important task,
but it's one I'd told myself I'd do like four or five days ago and
still haven't done--which again, just makes me feel like a bit of a
failure.

Anyway, that's my job today.

Okay, I didn't write my morning pages yesterday. In fact, I didn't do
almost anything yesterday. I literally watched tv all day. Pathetic. 
And now I have two days to do absolutely everything I need to do
before flying out on Thursday. I can't believe I'm coming down to the
end now.

I'm feeling a bit dazed. I slept for about 7.5 hours all told, but
for the last hour and a half I've been half-in and half-out. I put on
coffee, so hopefully once that comes I'll be awake again.

The big thing I've been struggling with has been Melissa. The night
before last I couldn't sleep because I was arguing with her in my
head, accusing her of all kinds of different things. I couldn't seelp
because I felt like I'd lost her entirely and I was floating somewhere
because rage and despair. It's stupid. I really don't know wh I get so
worked up. No, we're not the same as we used to be. Yes, she has
probably been happy to have some time to herself without being
attached. But that doesn't mean the end of the marriage. For God's
sake. It's just the way things in a marriage go. I'd still like to
talk to her about this stuff at some point, but she's not going to run
out on me. Get a fucking grip.

Yesterday was better on that, though, because I got to talk to her a
couple times. I watched TV all day yesterday just because... because I
was a total loser.

Anyway, the fire's lit now. I have to pack and clean this apartment in
the next two days. And I have to write my LGFP essay and finish my
dissertation proposal in the same amount of time. Ha! I'm going to be
strategic and prioritize the writing, because there's absolutely no
question of not getting the packing done. So I'm going to run through
my routine this morning, then head over to the library and start
working. LGFP first! Or no: email the department and then LGFP. Then I
can do a couple things over lunch on packing, go back to the library
for a couple hours to finish the LGFP essay, then come back home to
pack. Packing actually shouldn't take me that long. There's a lot of
stuff, but it's in a fairly small space.

What am I thinking about now? I started to drift off into the details
of the packing, but I don't need to think about that just yet. And
just now I was starting to drift off into thoughts about what this
kind of freewriting does for me, and how important it is that I stick
closely to the words I'm actually typing, and how difficult that is. I
need to check on the coffee. --No, the coffee hasn't even started
percolating yet.

Okay, now I"m just starting to block on anything. Deep breath. Focus
your mind a bit. Think about one thing. Think about the sounds of
Bologna and the feelings of sitting here on a summer morning, in front
of your open window, just before 9am. .

That coffee goes from nothing to done pretty fast.

As always, I can hear the workers from Coop underneath my window
dragging their carts across the stone walkways. That's the sound that
always wakes us up in the morning. I can hear workers scraping and
painting in the apartment building next to ours, up on the top
floor--the fourt floor, if we're counting European-style. The fan is
on in the bedroom, and it's pulling a light breeze from what's still a
shockingly cool morning outside.

I dreamed that Melissa was pregnant last night, and about to have the
baby. I remember feeling weirdly detached, and Melissa being even more
detached from me. First I had forgotten that today might be the day,
and I had lingered at wherever I was, and only realized when I was
close to home (which was an apartment in a city I didn't know) that,
shit, she might have had the baby today! and I ran back. And then I
get back and Melissa is walking around the house on the phone with her
mom, and she's already had the baby, and already named it, and doesn't
seem to care that I hadn't been there. Hadn't tried to call when she
went into labor or anything like that.

I keep having these kinds of dreams, and I have no idea what to do
with them.

I had been afraid last week that we would get pregnant after, a week
and a half ago, we had vaginal sex for the first time in ages. We used
protection and everything, but still: wouldn't it be a cruel irony if
Melissa's first attempt to have sex with me in so long, which wasn't
particularly convincing, actually tied us together permanently?

She went down on me last night, which was unexpected and a bit
uncomfortable. She had been drinking. I don't know what to do in those
situations. I haven't been making any moves, and last night I did
nothing to encourage her. She was lucid. But it's like she needs a bit
of liquid courage before she can handle doing anything with me, and
that feels... weird. Bad. I don't know if I should stop it, or if it's
part of the process for her of recovering a desire that's real but has
been covered over for a while. God, I don't know.


Anyway, I need to move on with my day. I need to think about something
new. I need to make sure I know what's going on with my week. I keep
saying that I want to do weekly planning sessions on Sunday mornings,
and more than anything I need to do one today, since this is the first
week of the new semester. I also need to do laundry so I can look
presentable the next couple of days. I need to tidy my bedroom and
desk area. Remember to tackle the problems that are bothering you the
most!

Which problems are bothering me the most right now? Besides Melissa,
which I don't yet know how to tackle. Therapy starts Tuesday.

General social unease. You can keep dealing with that in therapy, but
you should also reincorporate the social anxiety stuff into your
Sunday work sessions.

The yard. It's amazing how happy seeing Melissa's work yesterday made
me. The yard embarrasses me and overwhelms me. But it's actually not
unmanageable. Start devoting little bits of time to clearing that
thing out.

The basement. It grosses me out every time I go down there. Finish
clean up and set up.

General tidiness.
