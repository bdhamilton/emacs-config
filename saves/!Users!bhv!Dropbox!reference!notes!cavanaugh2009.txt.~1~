# 2, The Invention of Religion

Main argument: there is no transhistorical and transcultural concept
of religion, and the attempt to say there is belongs to a
power-configuration specific to the construction of the liberal
nation-state in the West.

## _Religio_

The opening section explains older concepts of _religio_. He mentions
_religio_ in ancient Rome as having primarily to do with social ritual
and custom, _religio_ in Augustine as having to do with right worship
of God, and _religio_ in Aquinas as a virtue related to justice,
rendering to God what is God's due. _Religio_ is _not_ a universal
category of which Christianity is a genus, it's not a system of
beliefs, it's not an interior impulse, it's not a separate
institutional force, and it's not separate from political activity
("medieval Christendom was a theopolitical whole" [68]). (Especially
on that last point, he lets Aquinas do way too much definitional
work. He never raises the question of whether Thomas's political
theology actually matched the existing social situation in medieval
Europe.) 

Cavanaugh's suggestion is that if older concepts of _religio_ were not
distinct in the way the modern concept is, it's meaningless to ask
whether "religion" rather than something else was the real cause of
violence in those cultures. "The modern claim that religion causes
more violence than something else depends upon the existence of a
sphere of non-religion, a secular realm. As should be obvious,
however, there was no such secular sphere until it was invented in
modernity" (69). That whole line of argument seems flawed to me. It
seems perfectly legitimate to identify a certain type of human
activity and look for it in other periods of time, even if they didn't
conceptualize it in the same. It's important to be sensitive to the
ways they classified things differently, because that undoubtedly
structures the activity we're interested in, but the use of a
distinction unfamiliar to another culture isn't necessarily an
imposition. (I think I remember Castoriadis saying that it's precisely
this kind of _rub_ between the historian and the culture the historian
is studying that makes historical work fruitful.) It's still fruitful
to ask about the influence of economic questions on medieval theology,
for example, even if the medievals had no sense of economics as a
distinct field of inquiry.

## The Invention of Religion in the West

The second section traces (very rapidly) the creation of the modern
concept of "religion." The history starts with Nicholas of Cusa and
Marsilio Ficino, who he thinks begin the process of "interiorizing"
and "universalizing" the idea of _religio_. (There's no mention of the
shifting perception of Islam as a factor in Cusa's work.) He mentions
